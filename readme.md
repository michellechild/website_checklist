#Web Design Checklist 

A one-(long)-page responsive checklist for designers to reference when creating a website. Some items are repeated in a few categories, but I think that's a good thing. &rsquo;Cause let&rsquo;s face it, who can remember everything everytime? 

And why would you?


##About the Design

I often start with a color pallette when designing, and let the grid, form and other styles happen from there. The colors used here are bright, cheery, and create a strong contrast against a black or white background. 

With this particular project I wanted something a little loud and trendy&mdash; I&rsquo;m actually designing for designers here. The circles in the navigation bar contribute to the light, cheery theme. 

Lots of padding, simple form, and large type are used here to break up this sometimes dense information into small, manageable chunks.

I changed the original black color here to a darker gray, as it is difficult to read white-on-black on a screen. 

The site ranges from a five to one column grid, to allow for sufficient white space depending on size. 

Animations in the site are subtle and add to the users experience. 

###Categories include:
* HTML

####One more thing(s)
This is an ongoing work in process: the more you know, the more things to remember.
 
This site is typeset in Freight Sans Pro and Jubilat from Adobe Typekit. 

The checklist began as project for the Fall 2014 Web Design class at the Iron Yard in Greenville, SC.
