#Web Design Checklist 

A one-(long)-page responsive checklist for designers to reference when creating a website. &rsquo;Cause let&rsquo;s face it, who can remember everything everytime? 

And why would you?

I often start with a color pallette when designing, and let the grid, form and other styles happen from there. The colors used here are bright,cheery, and create a strong contrast against a black or white background. With this particular project I wanted something a little loud and trendy&mdash; I&rsquo;m actually designing for designers here.

Based on my research, I changed the original black color here to a darker gray, as it is difficult to read white-on-black on a screen. The site ranges from a five to one column grid, to allow for sufficient white space depending on size. The animations in the site are semi-subtle and add to the users experience. 

This is an ongoing work in process: the more you know, the more things to remember.
 
This site began as project for the Fall 2014 Web Design class at the Iron Yard in Greenville, SC.
